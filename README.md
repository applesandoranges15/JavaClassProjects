# JavaClassProjects
Class projects completed during CS 351: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms at the University of Wiconsin-Milwaukee. 

Homework 1: Demonstrated knowledge of object oriented programming fundamentals by modeling a particle with fields of position, modeling, mass, and color.

Homework 4: Mastered implementation of stack and queue structures for 'endogenous' coin objects, emphasizing code efficiency through inheritance, exclusive container ownership for the Coin class, and enhanced testing capabilities using a 'spy' class for controlled internal access.

Homework 7: Mastered the implementation of stacks and queues for 'endogenous' coin objects, utilizing inheritance to optimize code structure, ensuring exclusive container ownership for coins, and incorporating a 'spy' class for effective testing, offering valuable experience for prospective employers in data structures and algorithms.

Homework 8: Applied advanced data structures by re-implementing the ApptBook ADT using a Binary Search Tree for enhanced efficiency, addressing complexities such as accommodating duplicates, implementing cursor methods, and utilizing recursive helpers, culminating in a comprehensive test-driven approach.

Homework 9: Leveraged advanced data structures to re-implement the NewApptBook ADT using a binary search tree, addressing removal complexities, implementing efficient iterators, and ensuring a robust test-driven approach for reliability and performance.

Homework 11: Created a high-performance StringCache using open-address linear hashing within a hash table, ensuring constant-time access to elements, and implement efficient string interning for improved algorithmic efficiency, demonstrating strong understanding of hash table data structures and optimization techniques.

Homework 12: Developed a task scheduler with task dependencies using the 'topological sort' algorithm, emphasizing non-recursive depth-first search to handle large graphs efficiently, demonstrating proficiency in graph algorithms, algorithmic optimization, and depth-first search implementation.
